# Gait-Analysis-via-phone-camera
The work is on making an app accessible to general public to analyse their gait via general kinematics.

> Building an app for gait analysis involves several key steps and technologies. Here's a step-by-step process along with the necessary technologies for each stage:

1. **Research and Planning**:
   - Research gait analysis methodologies, biomechanics, and common walking abnormalities.
   - Identify key features and functionalities for the app.
   - Plan the user interface and experience.

2. **Computer Vision and Image Processing**:
   - Utilize computer vision algorithms to process video frames captured by the phone's camera.
   - Technologies: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), TensorFlow, PyTorch.

3. **Pose Estimation**:
   - Implement pose estimation algorithms to identify key points on the user's body during walking.
   - Technologies: OpenPose, PoseNet, MediaPipe Pose.

4. **Data Analysis and Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the data collected from pose estimation to identify irregularities and posture imbalances.
   - Implement algorithms to detect deviations from normal gait patterns.
   - Technologies: Machine learning (for classification and pattern recognition), Python data analysis libraries (NumPy, pandas).

5. **User Interface (UI) Development**:
   - Design and develop an intuitive UI for users to interact with the app.
   - Include features for capturing video, displaying analysis results, and providing feedback.
   - Technologies: Android Studio (for Android apps), Xcode (for iOS apps), Flutter or React Native for cross-platform development.

6. **Integration with Backend (Optional)**:
   - If you plan to store user data or provide cloud-based features, integrate the app with a backend server.
   - Technologies: Node.js, Django, Flask for backend development; Firebase, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform for cloud services.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of gait analysis results.
   - Test the app on a diverse range of devices and with users from different demographics.
   - Technologies: Testing frameworks like Jest (for React Native), XCTest (for iOS), Espresso (for Android).

8. **Deployment**:
   - Prepare the app for deployment to the Google Play Store (for Android) or Apple App Store (for iOS).
   - Follow platform-specific guidelines for app submission and review processes.

9. **Continued Improvement**:
   - Gather user feedback and iterate on the app to improve its performance, accuracy, and usability over time.
   - Stay updated with advancements in computer vision and machine learning for potential enhancements.

This process requires a combination of skills in software development, computer vision, machine learning, and user interface design.
